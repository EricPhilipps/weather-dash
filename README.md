<h1 align="center">Functionality</h1>

<p>This application starts with a screen in which no information is shown except a search form in the top right of the screen. When a user searches a city, they are able to see the current and future weather forecast for that city. The information given includes the temperature, wind speed, humidity, UV index and a description of the weather with an icon indicating the conditions. This information is found using the Open Weather Map API. First the latitude and longitude of the city is found using one query, then a second query is used to find the weather in that area using the latitude and longitude. From viewing the weather of the city the user searched they are able to search another city and view that weather in that city as well.</p>
